# Itron Questionnaire Editor Test 

**I needed to make a server regarding to the web browsers CORS policy.**

The server i based on Node.js, but I used express.js framework for the server.
As long as I know, the server wasn't part of the test regarding to that this is a front-end position :)
If it is a problem, I can rewrite the server side as well with base node.js.
The front end part is plain ES6 javascript, CSS and HTML.

To run the server you will need express.js and node.js as well.
I have commited the package.json and package-lock.json files as well to make it easier.

You can run the server for the full test with node, like

```node server.js```
